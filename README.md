# **Machine Learning Course Project â€“ Hotel Booking Service**

This is the code repository for my Machine Learning course final project!

## **Abstract**

For this project, our goal was to identify the best model for predicting a certain day's label. To achieve this, we first removed less relevant variables and reset the adr, before exploring the relationship between the labels and adr. We then trained the dataset using three different models: L2-regularized logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN) models.

## **Technology Used**

This project is mainly based on Python. Three different models were implemented and compared.

- L2-Regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Neural Network (NN)
